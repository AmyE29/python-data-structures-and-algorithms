# Stacks and Queues

**Author**: Amy Evans
**Version**: 1.0.0


## Challenge
Create Node, Stack and Queue classes.
In the Stack class:
    Push a node onto the stack
    Pop a node off the stack
    Peek at the node at the top of the stack
    And look to see if the stack is empty
In the Queue class:
    Add a new node to the back of the queue (enqueue)
    Remove a node from the front of the queue (dequeue)
    Peek at the node at the front of the queue
    And look to see if the queue is empty

## Approach & Efficiency
In all cases adding, removing and seeing the head of a stack or a queue can be done in O(1).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

## Architecture
python  pipenv  Tested with Pytest
