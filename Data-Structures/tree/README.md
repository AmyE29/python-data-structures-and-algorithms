###Binary Trees

##### Author: Amy Evans Version: 1.0.0

#####Overview
Create a Binary Tree class
that traverses the tree using the preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder methods which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Create a Binary Search Tree class that adds a value to the tree and another method that returns a boolean if a value is contained as least once in the tree

##### Approach & Efficiency
Binary Tree:
Time O(n)
Space: O(n)

Binary Search Tree:
Time O(h)
Space: O(1)
