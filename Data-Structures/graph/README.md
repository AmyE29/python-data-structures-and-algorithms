### challege
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- AddNode(): Takes in the value of that node and returns it.
- AddEdge() : Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph, includes  the ability to have a “weight”
- GetNodes(): Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection 
- GetNeighbors(): Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
- Size(): Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
